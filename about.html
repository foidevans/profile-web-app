              I'm Favour Evans, a creative front-end developer passionate about
              crafting beautiful, interactive, and accessible web experiences. I
              love bringing designs to life and making technology feel warm,
              fuzzy and human.

            <h2>Goals in this Program</h2>
            <p>
              My main goal is to sharpen my React and project management skills,
              understand how the Web works, network with like-minded people and
              industry leaders while learning to build scalable and
              user-friendly web applications.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
              I'm scared of making mistakes so I tend not to try new things. I'm
              not too good at fetching APIs and I'm still a newbie when it comes
              to libraries, frameworks and complex React patterns, but I'm
              improving through consistent practice and mentorship.

              You've come far, and you're still growing. Keep your curiosity,
              stay patient and persistent, stay kind, and never stop building
              things that make people smile.

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Repetition is the mother of skill. Document everything and take
              learning one step at a time. I believe design and development are
              two halves of creativity. Together, they tell stories that move
              people.
